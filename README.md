# Competitive Programming

This repository contains solutions to various algorithmic problems by [Gourav](https://github.com/GouravKhunger) and also, others who contributed previously to [CodeForces](https://github.com/GouravKhunger/CodeForces) and [SPOJ](https://github.com/GouravKhunger/SPOJ) repositories, which are now closed and merged within this repo.

The solved codes are placed in folders which correspond to their platform and within sub-folders according to their name, or rating folders.

You are welcomed to open Pull Requests and improve existing code's efficiency, or add new solutions to the problems. But be sure to read the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file from each judge's folder first.
